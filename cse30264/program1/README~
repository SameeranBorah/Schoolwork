John F. Lake, Jr. 
CSE 30264
Program 1


	For this assignment, I made a UDP client which sends a message or file to a server and gets back a message with a timestamp as a result.  The files in my dropbox are the following: 

File1.txt
File2.txt 
File3.txt  Simple text files for testing the client. 
udpclient.c: C source code for the UDP client. 
udpclient: Binary for my program
README: Descriptive file for the assignment. 















I received help from the socket guide given in class: http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/output/html/singlepage/bgnet.html#getaddrinfo, and I consulted the book as well.
