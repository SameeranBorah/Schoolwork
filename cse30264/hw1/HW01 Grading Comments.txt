c. -2pts. BDP is the MAXIMUM amount of data/bits, i.e., the "upper-bound" in transit, not necessarily the number of bits at "any given time" between two nodes. If at any given time, the link is 
fully utilized between every node pair, the network performance (and the quality of user experience) would be severely degraded. 

d. -2pt. 
2.5MB != 2.5*10^6 bits, you'd have to further multiple it by 8 to transform from B to b.  
We require at least one RTT from sending the request before the first bit
of the picture could begin arriving at the ground (TCP would take longer).
25 MB is 200Mb. Assuming bandwidth delay only, it would then take
200Mb/1000Mbps = 0.2 seconds to finish sending, for a total time of 0.2+
2.57 = 2.77 sec until the last picture bit arrives on earth.
