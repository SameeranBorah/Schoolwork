\section{Solution}
	The solution lies in changing line 7.  Size is a pointer, so "int s = size;" sets s to be a memory address, not the size wanted.  The simple solution is to add * before size. 
\section{Debugging Output}
\begin{verbatim}
	The debugger gave the following output when I tested the value of variable s: 
	(gdb) print s
	$6 = -9420
	The variable size was also tested: 
	(gdb) print size
	$5 = (int *) 0x7fffffffdb34
	Because size and s are different types, it is wrong to assign s to size.
	You need to dereference it first.  
\end{verbatim}	
\section{Methodology}
	In order to solve the problem, I first looked at the source code briefly, to find any egregious errors.  After looking at this, I used gdb to test certain variables, such as size and s.  
	Because the program initially didn't print anything, I suspected something was wrong in the printArray function.  I was correct, as the error was indeed in a declaration statement in this
	function.
