1.) 
	1.)Covering material before the homework is assigned would be helpful. (Some homework assignments required us to use material we had not learned 		   yet.)
	
	2.)In the future, perhaps substituting one of the class days for a lab or practical workshop would be helpful for getting more experience working 		   with the unix envoronment.  I know I would have learned the material better if I had the ability to ask quesions to a professor or TA, rather 		   than just googling.  

2.) 
	The book was very helpful for learning regular expressions for certain tools, and for explaining the purpose and uses of awk, sed, and grep.  I think the book is a bit intimidating though; the first few chapters are incredibly dense and are hard to follow.  I have only used the book for explanations of the sed, grep, and awk commands, and for help on csh and bash.  

3.) 
	The lecture slides have helped me very much with some of the material, but I feel as though there is a lot of extra imformation crammed into the slides.  I think they could be a bit more organized, but they are by no means bad right now.  

4.) 
	I have learned how to do shell scripting in the C-Shell and the Bourne Shell, and I have learned the basics of regular expressions and important Unix commands (sed, grep, and awk.)
