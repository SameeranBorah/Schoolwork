Programming Assignment #1: Reverse Polish Notation Calculator

For this assignment, I changed or made a total of 3 files:
-stack.h  
-calc.cxx
-ccalc.cxx
	
stack.h: 
For this file, I implemented templated types, so that different objects could be pushed onto the stack.  This was an easy fix; I simply 
prefaced the class definition with the template definition, and I replaced all of the specific variables with generic types. 

Next, I implemented the stack functions using the <list> data structure supplied by the STL as a single private data member. 
I implemented these functions and the constructor: 

stack(), which initializes the stack and makes sure it's empty.  
empty(), which returns if the stack is empty. 
push(T x), which adds a value to the top of the stack.
pop(), which gets rid of the top member of the stack.
top(), which returns the top member of the stack.  

calc.cxx: 
For this file, I only added a square root option, which takes the square root of the item at the top of the stack.  
If the number is negative, an error message is thrown. 

ccalc.cxx:
For this file, I copied the content of calc.cxx and made it accessable with complex numbers.  

I replaced all instances of "double" with "complex<double>" and rewrote the square root operation so that it would work with 
complex numbers. 


After making the changes to all of the files, I ran the tests test_prog1 and test_prog1.sh.  All of the tests passed when I last
tested the program.
