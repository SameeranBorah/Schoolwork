Lab 5 Report

	For the second part of the lab, I chose the snowflake as the type of fractal to use for the gallery.  I set up a screen with 16 different versions, with arbitrary inputs.  
Each version of the snowflake varies in size, thickness (depth), and the angle between each branch.  Because of the different angles, some of the snowflakes have shapes that aren't 
symmetric.
