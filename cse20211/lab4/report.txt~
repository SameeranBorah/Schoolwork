	For the last program, my goal was to create a ride which consisted of 6 parts: the central wheel, 10 length-shifting 
pistons protruding from the wheel, a rod swinging from the end of those pistons, a stick attached perpindicular to the swinging rod, 
which shifts in length, spinning rods attached to each end of the shifting stick, and circles, denoting passenger carts, attached 
to those spinning rods.  

	The difficulty in making this program came from the calculations involving the angles for the rods - I had to compute angles relative to 
other, changing angles, so it was definitely cumbersome.  The program works correctly - the user sees all of the aforementioned parts moving with a 
speed that varies from slow to fast, and the user can exit the program instantly by pressing the key 'q'. Functions were used in producing each part 
of the program, and each function calls the functions of the parts that are attached to their repective part. 
  

	To check the program, I ran it after I added each subsequent part, to ensure that the locations were correct, and then proceeded step by 
step with each additional piece, knowing that the reference points from the previous points were correct. After finishing the program, I ran it continuously to see if any unexpected errors would come about from a longer run.  After extensive running, I concluded that the program was ready.
