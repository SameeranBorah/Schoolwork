Lab 3 Report

	For this lab, I was required to construct three programs.  The first two
were structured and had given instructinos; I was to create a program that let 
the user display various symbols on the screen, and a program that displayed a
bouncing ball.  The third program gave me a bit of creativity; however, I 
probably could have come up with something more entertaining. 
	For my program, I display a spinning wand, with varying shapes, colors
and sizes, controlled by the user.  The user can press 's', and a star will
shoot out in the direction the wand is facing. The wand constantly spins 
counterclockwise, and changes colors constantly.  The user can change the shape 
of the end of the wand by pressing a number between 3 and 9, inclusive.  If the 
user presses 't' or 'g', the wand will get longer or shorter.  If the user presses 
'y' or 'h', the wand will speed up or slow down.  If the user presses 'q', the 
program will end.  
	I tested this program by ensuring that the user could not do anything which 
could break the program.  I made sure that the program had limits on the speed and 
length of the wand, so that the user could not set the wand to a condition which 
would break the graphics engine.  I ensured the program worked correctly by testing 
every key, and made sure that each expected action happened.  
   	The program works by using a while loop, which constantly checks if the 
program is running.  The program increments an angle from zero to 2*pi, and resets 
to zero if it runs over 2*pi.  Using this angle, a wand is drawn out from the center 
of the screen, and is drawn using a function.  User input changes a variety of 
variables, and the wand reacts accordingly.
