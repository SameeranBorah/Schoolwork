Fundamentals of Computing I Lab 1

	For this lab, I constructed 3 programs.  The first program simply
states "Welcome to C!"; the second program tells the score of a football team
given their TD's, safeties, field goals, and extra points; and the third program
gives the force between 2 objects of distance r and masses m1 & m2.

	This program essentially reduces the amount of work that the user 
would have to do using the gravitational force equation. The program is 
structured into a few parts.  The first part is where all of the variables are 
declared, the second part is where the user gives the necessary inputs for the 
masses and the distance, and the third part is where the calculations take
place and the force is displayed.   

	To evaluate the program, I put a series of test printf commands to 
ensure that the data was being passed to the variables correctly. After this, I 
used a calculator on the internet to verify that every calculation was working
correctly.  I verified that it produces results correctly, and there are no 
cases in which the results are false.
